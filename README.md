# REALTIME-HUMAN-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM-FOR-A-CLIPPED-REGION
This project detects a human in real-time if they enter the camera frame and tracts them until they leave. The frame has a marked region that prohibits the entry of any human and if a human surpasses the boundary of that region an alarm is generated in the form of an email that goes to the owner. This eliminates the need for personnel for continuous monitoring of these regions. The only time any person needs to intervene is when the alarm goes off. This project uses You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) Algorithm with Simple Online and Realtime Tracker (SORT) Algorithm to detect and track all the humans that enter the camera frame. It also has an alarm system that uses SendGrid API to send emails to any requested email ID.
